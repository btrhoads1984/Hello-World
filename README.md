# Hello-World
This is my first repository to help me learn GitHub

I am an adult student at Mott Community College. I plan on introducing GitHub to the Computer Tech Club, and
using it as a remote collaboration tool for my classmates and myself. I also work as a Peer-to-Peer Tutor
and want to explore any tools GitHub has to offer for aiding students that request tutoring.
